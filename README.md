Budget App: Group Project

Specs were to make a budget tracker which took in a budger total from the user and displayed items that were added to the input. The running totals are displayed of what is left in the budget as well as how much has been spent. The item totals are also added into spending categories, where totals are displayed numerically, as well as in a pie chart. We added the chart as an extra accessory outside of the project guidelines. This was the first group project of the bootcamp, and took place after we were focusing on JS DOM events.
